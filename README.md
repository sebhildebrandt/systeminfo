# systeminformation

Simple system and OS information library for [node.js][nodejs-url]

  [![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
  [![NPM Downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]
  [![MIT license][license-img]][license-url]

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install systeminformation --save
```

### Usage

All functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous functions. Here a small example how to use them:

```
var si = require('systeminformation');

si.cpu(function(data) {
	console.log('CPU-Information:');
	console.log(data);
})
```

### Major Changes - Version 2

There are a lot of changes in version 2 of systeminformation! Here is a quick overview:

New Functions  

- `version`: returns systeminformation version (semver)
- `system`: hardware info (manufacturer, product/model name, version, serial, uuid)
- `networkConnections`: number of active connections
- `inetLatency`: latency in ms to external resource (internet)
- `getStaticData`: returns on json object with static data at once (OS, CPU, Network Interfaces - they should not change until restarted)
- `getDynamicData`: returns on json object with all dynamic data at once (e.g. for monitoring agents)
- `getAllData`: returns on json object with all data (static and dynamic) at once

Renamed Functions (now all camelCase)

- `osinfo`: renamed to `osInfo`
- `cpu_currentspeed`: renamed to `cpuCurrentspeed`
- `cpu_temperature`: renamed to `cpuTemperature`
- `fs_size`: renamed to `fsSize`
- `fs_speed`: renamed to `fsStats`
- `network_interfaces`: renamed to `networkInterfaces`
- `network_speed`: renamed to `networkStats`
- `network_connections`: renamed to `networkConnections`
- `currentload`: renamed to `currentLoad`
- `fullload`: renamed to `fullLoad`
- `processload`: renamed to `processLoad`
- `checksite`: renamed to `inetChecksite`

Function Changes

- `cpu_temperature`/`cpuTemperature`: -1 is new default (and indicates that non sensors are installed)
- `cpu_temperature`/`cpuTemperature`: new result `max` which returns max temperature of all cores
- `cpu_currentspeed`/`cpuCurrentspeed`: now in GHz
- `cpu`: splitted `manufacturer` (e.g. Intel) and `brand` (e.g. Core 2 Duo)
- `network_speed`/`networkStats`: now better support for OS X (also support for `operstate`)
- `network_speed`/`networkStats`: overall received and transferred bytes (rx, tx)
- `mem`: now better support for OS X (also support for `swaptotal`, `swapused`, `swapfree`)
- `fs_size`/`fsSize`: use-values now in % (0 - 100% instead of 0 - 1)  
- `fs_speed`/`fsStats`: now also full support for OS X
- `checksite`/`inetChecksite`: new result structure - see command reference
- `checksite`/`inetChecksite`: ms (former `response_ms`): -1 if not ok

Other changes

- no more external dependencies: `request` is not longer needed
- where possible results are now integer or float values (instead of strings) because it is easier to calculate with numbers ;-)

**Be aware**, that the new version 2.x is **NOT backward compatible** to version 1.x ....

## Core concept

[Node.js][nodejs-url] comes with some basic OS information, but I always wanted a little more. So I came up to write this
little library. This library is still work in progress. In version 2 I cleaned up a lot of inconsistencies and bugs, but
there is for sure room for improvement. I was only able to test it on several Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu distributions as well
as OS X (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Captain). Version 2 now also supports nearly all functionality on OS X/Darwin platforms.
But be careful, this library will definitely NOT work on Windows platforms!

If you have comments, suggestions & reports, please feel free to contact me!

## Reference

### Sections

This library is splitted in several sections:

1. General
2. System (HW)
3. Operating System
4. CPU
5. Memory
6. File System
7. Network
8. Processes
9. Users
10. Internet
11. GetAll

### cb: Asynchronous Function Calls (callback)

Remember: all functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous (callback) functions!
So another example, how to use a specific function might be:

```
var si = require('systeminformation');

si.networkStats('eth1', function(data) {
	console.log('Network Interface Stats (eth1):');
	console.log('- is up: ' + data.operstate);
	console.log('- RX bytes overall: ' + data.rx);
	console.log('- TX bytes overall: ' + data.tx);
	console.log('- RX bytes/sec: ' + data.rx_sec);
	console.log('- TX bytes/sec: ' + data.tx_sec);
})
```

## Known Issues

There is one major things, that I was still not able to solve:

For OS X, I did not find a reliable way to get the CPU temperature. All suggestions I found did not work on current version of OS X on different machines (intel platform). So if anyone has an idea, this would be helpful.

I am happy to discuss any comments and suggestions. Please feel free to contact me if you see any possibility of improvement!
